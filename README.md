Problem statement  ------
"Many teams still host source code in Azure DevOps Git repositories but want to migrate to GitHub to take advantage of GitHub's ecosystem like integrated CI/CD, a large community, better integrations, and advanced collaboration features. Simple pushes can miss large blobs, lose context like PRs, or push incomplete file sets because of LFS needs, submodules, or repository-size constraints. Our goal was to create a tool that discovers repository contents and risks ahead, produces a readable discovery report, and migrates the repo while generating a post-migration verification report."

Motivation — why is that matters performing discovery before migration? Because it is like blind migration causes - oversized files can break pushes or blow up repository size limits; binary-heavy repos are poor fits for plain Git and often need Git LFS; submodules and .gitmodules entries need special handling; and pull requests, branch histories, and tags are valuable context that teams preserves. A discovery step gives stakeholders facts — file counts, branch sizes, large and binary file locations, contributor counts — so they can plan LFS adoption, prune branches, and get buy-in. The script we're discussing automates that discovery and provides a best-effort migration and verification flow."

High-level summary of what the code does
"This Python script performs three core flows:

Discovery: It queries Azure DevOps via its REST API to list branches, tags, tree items, commits, and pull requests, then computes file sizes accurately (per-branch and for the default branch), identifies large files and binaries, and builds an HTML discovery report.
Migration (optional): It can create a repo on GitHub, mirror-push all refs using git mirror clone + push, and attempt to recreate PRs on GitHub with best-effort metadata.
Verification: After migration, it queries the GitHub repo trees per branch and generates a post-migration HTML report listing which files were found or missing and attempts to provide reasons for missing entries."
Spoken code walkthrough — top-level structure (what to say while showing the file)
"Walk me through the file structure: the script is a single Python program. It imports standard modules like os, subprocess, threading utilities, and requests. There are helper utilities, Azure DevOps API wrappers, a report builder that compiles all the findings into JSON and HTML, migration helpers that do git mirror flows and recreate PRs, and the CLI main() that ties everything together."

Utilities and constants
"At the top you'll see constants and helpers:

API_VERSION: specifies the Azure DevOps API version used.
LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD_MB / BYTES: the threshold (100MB) used to mark files as large and candidates for Git LFS.
parse_ado_repo_url and parse_github_repo_url: basic URL parsers to extract org/project/repo or owner/repo.
human_size: a small helper to format byte counts for human-friendly output."
Explain why the 100MB threshold: "GitHub's recommended thresholds and usual LFS thresholds make 100MB a sensible cutoff for LFS consideration."

Azure DevOps API helpers
"Functions like ado_get, get_repo_metadata, list_items, list_commits, list_tags, and list_pull_requests wrap REST calls. Note the script uses requests with basic auth (PAT for ADO). The list_items call can request full recursion and content metadata so we have a starting size estimate."

Emphasize network safety: "The code disables InsecureRequestWarning and sometimes sets verify=False for convenience; point out that in a production setting you'd want to enable certificate verification."

Accurate blob sizing & parallel fetching
"A key part is getting accurate blob sizes. Azure DevOps's items listing includes a size but it's not always accurate for all blobs, so the script includes get_blob_size which fetches blob metadata by object ID. fetch_sizes_for_items runs many of those fetches in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor to speed things up — you can display the live progress indicator printed to console while it runs."

Explain why parallelism matters: "Large repositories can contain tens of thousands of blobs. Sequential requests would be extremely slow; parallel threads make discovery feasible."

Per-branch scanning and aggregation
"The build_report function is the heart: it iterates over branches, lists items for each branch, fetches accurate sizes for the branch's blobs, aggregates per-branch total sizes, identifies large files per branch, and composes a global file list. It then computes summary statistics — totals, averages, top contributors, binary ratios, and a readiness status (Ready, Requires Attention) with migration risk notes."

Point out submodule handling: "The script detects .gitmodules and records submodule entries with branch context. It attempts to merge submodule occurrences across branches to show where external dependencies exist."

Report generation (Discovery)
"After building a structured report object, the script renders it to an HTML template. The discovery report includes:

Repo metadata (owner, project, repo id, repo-size)
Summary statistics (file counts, sizes, binary/large files)
Branch storage breakdown
Lists of large files (by branch and global)
Binary files list
Permission mapping recommendation and LFS recommendation
Extension breakdown and top contributors
Files are written to the user's Desktop by default as 'Discovery_report.html'. This HTML is styled simply for readability."

Migration helpers and steps
"If the user opts to migrate, the script:

Uses the ADO PAT to build an https clone URL with embedded credentials (for automation).
Calls git clone --mirror to do a mirror clone of the ADO repo into a temporary directory. A mirror clone preserves all refs, branches, and tags.
Adds a remote pointing to the created GitHub repo (it creates the repo via the GitHub API if required).
Runs git push --mirror to push all refs to GitHub.
It constructs a push URL with the GitHub PAT embedded, and performs the push using subprocess calls to git. The migrate_via_git_mirror function prints progress and cleans up the temporary directory after."

Explain the advantage of mirror clone: "Mirror clone plus mirror push is the standard way to transfer all refs, tags, and history without rewriting. It’s quick and faithful — but it pushes blobs as-is, so LFS and large files must be handled before push if needed."

Recreating pull requests (best-effort)
"Because PRs in ADO are separate artifacts, the script iterates ADO PRs and attempts to recreate them on GitHub using the GitHub REST API. It maps title, description, source and target branches, and adds a note in the body that the PR was migrated from ADO. It will also attempt to close or merge the created PRs on GitHub to match the ADO status when possible."

Mention limitations: "This is best-effort: due to differences in API models, reviewers, labels, comments, and approvals may not be fully preserved. The script logs failures when creation fails."

Post-migration verification report
"After migration, the script generates a post-migration verification report. For each branch it fetches the GitHub tree recursively and compares expected paths (from the discovery scan) against what's actually present in the GitHub repository. For missing files, it attempts to infer the likely reason: case-only differences, renames/moves (same basename elsewhere), large files that might need LFS, binary files, or submodules. It then writes a per-branch HTML report 'migration_report.html' showing found vs missing files and reasons."

Explain heuristic checks: "Because we can’t always know why a file is missing, the script uses a few heuristics — case-insensitive match, same basename elsewhere, size-based checks — to provide actionable clues to the operator."

Demo talking points — what to show and say during a live demo
(Use this when the demo todo is in-progress/completed — these are ready to read aloud.)

Setup & Inputs
"Show the script file completed.py and explain required inputs: an Azure DevOps repo URL and an ADO PAT with read access; optionally, on migration, a GitHub PAT with repo creation and push scopes."
"Note: The script writes reports to the Desktop by default. Point this out so reviewers know where to look."
Run discovery only
"Run the script, enter the ADO repo URL and PAT, decline migration at the prompt."
While it runs, explain:
'Fetching data from Azure DevOps...' — the script calls repo metadata, branches, tags, commits, PRs.
'Processing blob sizes...' — show the per-file progress printed by fetch_sizes_for_items.
After completion, open Discovery_report.html and highlight:
Summary box with total size and file counts.
Branch storage table — show largest branches.
Large files per branch and Binary Files section — point to file paths that will create LFS or migration problems.
Recommendations: LFS, branch cleanup, PR strategy.
Run full migration (if allowed)
"If performing a real migration, provide GitHub PAT. The script will create the GitHub repo (if it doesn’t exist), mirror-clone the ADO repo, and push all refs."
Show the git commands being executed: git clone --mirror, git push --mirror.
After push, show the recreated PR printouts and any warnings if PR recreation failed.
Post-migration verification
"After migration, the script queries each GitHub branch tree and compares to the discovery snapshot. Open migration_report.html and show a missing-file example and the inferred reason, explaining how that would guide remediation."
Emphasize what to watch for in the demo
Long waits for very large repositories (explain expected runtime and the benefit of doing discovery first).
Errors: Git command failures, rate limits from APIs, or authentication failures (show how those appear).
Important points to stress (say these explicitly)
"Discovery before migration reduces risk: it gives you an inventory and helps you plan LFS adoption and branch cleanup."
"Parallel blob metadata fetches speed up discovery but will still take time for very large repos — plan accordingly."
"Mirror push preserves commits, tags, and refs, but binary and very large blobs still travel as-is unless you rewrite history or use LFS prior to push."
"PR recreation is helpful but limited — it's a best-effort transcription and won't fully replicate comments, approvals, or pipelines."
"The post-migration verification report is key: it tells you which files were not migrated and gives possible causes, enabling targeted fixes."
Limitations and caveats to call out
"The script disables SSL verification in requests (verify=False) and suppresses warnings. You should enable certificate verification in production."
"User credentials (PATs) are embedded into clone URLs for automation; this is convenient but requires secure handling — don’t store tokens in plain text or logs."
"It does not rewrite history to convert large files to LFS prior to push. If you need to migrate large binary files into LFS, you must re-write history or use a different pipeline before pushing to GitHub."
"PR recreation does not include comments, approvals, or pipeline status. It just recreates PRs with title/body and optionally merges or closes them."
"The default Desktop output path is hard-coded; for automation you might want to parameterize output directories."
Q&A prep — likely questions and succinct answers
Q: "Will this script preserve commit authorship and timestamps?" A: "Yes — mirror clone preserves full Git history including commit metadata."

Q: "What about very large files?" A: "The discovery marks files >=100MB and flags them as LFS candidates. The script doesn't convert existing history to use LFS — that requires history rewriting and a different workflow."

Q: "Can we migrate multiple repos in batch?" A: "The script is currently single-repo interactive, but it can be extended to accept a list of repositories and non-interactive tokens for batch automation."

Q: "How reliable is PR recreation?" A: "It's a best-effort recreation—titles, descriptions, and branch mappings are recreated. Reviewer assignments, comments, and approvals are generally not preserved."

Q: "Are there rate-limit or API concerns?" A: "Yes — both GitHub and ADO have API rate-limits. For very large or many repos, add retries and rate-limit backoff logic."

Q: "How secure is embedding PATs into clone URLs?" A: "Embedding PATs in URLs is convenient but risky. Use short-lived tokens or credential helpers and wipe temp directories after operations."

Suggested next steps and improvements (say these to wrap up)
"Parameterize the script: add CLI arguments for output path, non-interactive mode, timeout and concurrency settings."
"Add an optional pre-push history-rewrite step to convert large files to Git LFS (using git filter-repo) so pushes to GitHub succeed without blowing up the repo size."
"Add better preservation of PR metadata: comments, approvals, labels — this would need additional API calls and mapping logic."
"Add robust retry/backoff and rate-limit handling for REST API calls."
"Store reports in a central location (S3 or an artifact store) and add a small UI that lists discovery reports for multiple repos."
Closing line (final wrap)
"In short, this script gives teams the visibility they need to plan safe migrations from Azure DevOps to GitHub. It reduces surprises by reporting large and binary files, gives per-branch storage breakdowns, attempts to migrate and recreate PRs, and verifies post-migration results — all important steps to keep history intact and avoid push failures or data loss."
